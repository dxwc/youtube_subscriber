# Youtube Subscriber
Downloads feed from youtube channels and locally generates a simple html/css page to embed/display thumbnail/video link. As is should only work on linux due to the use of `strptime`. (See [youtube_subscriber.js](https://github.com/dxwc/youtube_subscriber.js) for implementation with Node.js that will work crossplatform)

See README on ![ytube_terminal](./ytube_terminal/) or ![ytube_gui](./ytube_gui) for specific details.
